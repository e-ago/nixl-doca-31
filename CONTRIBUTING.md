## Getting Started

Before contributing, please:

1. Review existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicate work
2. For significant changes, open an issue for discussion before implementation
3. Familiarize yourself with our code style and project structure
4. Set up your development environment according to our guidelines

## Development Environment

### Required Tools

- C++17 compatible compiler
- Meson build system
- Ninja build tool
- clang-format
- Python (for build scripts and testing)
- Git with DCO sign-off configured

### Building the Project

NIXL uses Meson and Ninja for building:

```bash
# Configure the build
meson setup build

# Build the project
ninja -C build

# Run tests
ninja -C build test
```

### Setting Up clang-format

All new C++ code must be formatted using the provided `.clang-format` configuration. Code formatting will be automatically checked for conformance in CI, and improperly formatted code will be rejected:

```bash
# Format only changed lines in staged files (recommended)
git clang-format

# Format only changed lines between commits
git clang-format HEAD~1

# Format only changed lines in specific files
git clang-format --diff path/to/file.cpp

# Alternative: Use clang-format-diff to format only changed lines
git diff -U0 --no-color HEAD^ | clang-format-diff -p1 -i

# Or format only unstaged changes
git diff -U0 --no-color | clang-format-diff -p1 -i
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks for Python code quality. Install them with:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Code Standards

### C++17 Guidelines

NIXL is a modern C++17 project. We adhere to the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) where appropriate. Key principles:

1. **Use modern C++ features**: Prefer `auto`, range-based loops, structured bindings, `std::optional`, etc.
2. **RAII everywhere**: Resource management through constructors/destructors
3. **Smart pointers for ownership**: Use `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr` appropriately
4. **Prefer `const` correctness**: Mark methods and variables `const` when appropriate
5. **Exception handling**: Exceptions are recommended for control-path code, while error codes should be used for data-path

### STL and Abseil Usage

1. **Prefer STL types**: Use rich STL types as the primary choice
   - Standard containers: `std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`, etc.
   - Modern utilities: `std::optional`, `std::variant`, `std::string_view`
   - Algorithms from `<algorithm>` and `<numeric>`

2. **Fallback to Abseil**: When STL lacks required functionality
   - String formatting: `absl::StrFormat`
   - Error handling: `absl::StatusOr` for data-path operations that return values with potential errors
   - High-performance containers: `absl::flat_hash_map` when needed
   - Logging utilities (integrated with NIXL logging)

3. **⚠️ WARNING: Never expose Abseil in public APIs**
   - Keep Abseil types internal to implementation files
   - Plugin and agent public APIs must only use STL types
   - Convert between Abseil and STL types at API boundaries

### Code Style

All code must adhere to the style guide in `docs/CodeStyle.md` and be formatted with `.clang-format`. Key points:

1. **Follow the existing code style** in the file/module you're modifying
2. **Use descriptive names** for variables, functions, and classes
3. **Document complex logic** with clear comments, but avoid redundant self-explanatory comments that don't add value
4. **Prefer clarity over cleverness**

### Error Handling

1. **Control-path code**: Use exceptions for exceptional conditions
   - `std::runtime_error` for runtime failures
   - `std::invalid_argument` for invalid parameters
   - Custom exceptions when appropriate

2. **Data-path code**: Use error codes for performance-critical paths
   - Return `nixl_status_t` or similar error codes
   - Avoid exceptions in hot paths

3. **Logging**: Use NIXL logging macros
   - `NIXL_ERROR`: Critical errors that prevent normal operation
     - System failures, resource exhaustion, unrecoverable errors
     - Failed operations that cannot continue
   - `NIXL_WARN`: Warning conditions that don't prevent operation but indicate problems
     - Deprecated API usage, performance degradation, recoverable errors
     - Fallback behavior, suboptimal configurations
   - `NIXL_INFO`: Informational messages about normal operation
     - Initialization complete, configuration loaded, major state changes
     - Connection established/closed, module lifecycle events
   - `NIXL_DEBUG`: Detailed debugging information for development
     - Function entry/exit, intermediate values, algorithm decisions
     - Variable states, decision branches, detailed flow information
   - `NIXL_TRACE`: Very detailed trace information for deep debugging
     - Per-packet processing, memory allocations, lock acquisitions
     - Low-level operations, fine-grained timing, verbose diagnostics

## Contributing Process

Contributions that fix documentation errors or that make small changes
to existing code can be contributed directly by following the rules
below and submitting an appropriate PR.

Contributions intended to add significant new functionality must
follow a more collaborative path described in the following
points. Before submitting a large PR that adds a major enhancement or
extension, be sure to submit a GitHub issue that describes the
proposed change so that the NIXL team can provide feedback.

- As part of the GitHub issue discussion, a design for your change
  will be agreed upon. An up-front design discussion is required to
  ensure that your enhancement is done in a manner that is consistent
  with NIXL's overall architecture.

- Testing is a critical part of any NIXL
  enhancement. You should plan on spending significant time on
  creating tests for your change. The NIXL team will help you to
  design your testing so that it is compatible with existing testing
  infrastructure.

- If your enhancement provides a user visible feature then you need to
  provide documentation.

### Review Process Expectations

We greatly appreciate all contributions to NIXL! To maintain the high quality, performance, and security standards that our users depend on, we have a thorough review process. Here's what to expect:

#### Timeline and Iterations

- Initial review typically takes 1-2 weeks depending on PR complexity and reviewer availability
- Most PRs require 2-4 rounds of review before merging
- Complex features may take longer as we ensure architectural consistency

#### Why Our Review Process is Thorough

- NIXL is used in performance-critical environments where reliability is paramount
- We maintain backward compatibility and stable APIs for our users
- Security and correctness are non-negotiable in data movement operations
- We aim for code that is maintainable by the community long-term

#### How We Support Contributors

- Reviewers provide detailed feedback to help improve the contribution
- We're here to collaborate, not just critique - ask questions if feedback is unclear
- For significant changes, we may suggest incremental PRs to make review easier
- The team will help ensure your contribution aligns with NIXL's architecture

#### Tips for Smoother Reviews

- Start with smaller PRs to familiarize yourself with our standards
- Engage early through issues for design discussions
- Be responsive to feedback and ask for clarification when needed
- Consider breaking large changes into logical, reviewable chunks

We recognize that our standards are high, but this ensures NIXL remains a reliable foundation for critical workloads. Your patience and collaboration through the review process is genuinely appreciated, and we're committed to helping your contribution succeed.

## Plugin Development

### Creating New Plugins

When contributing new plugins, follow these guidelines:

#### 1. Plugin Structure

Plugins are located in `src/plugins/`. Your plugin should follow this structure:

```text
src/plugins/your_plugin/
├── meson.build
├── your_plugin.cpp
├── your_plugin.h
├── your_backend.cpp
├── your_backend.h
└── README.md
```

Tests should be added in the GoogleTest-based test directory:

```text
test/gtest/unit/plugins/your_plugin/
└── test_your_plugin.cpp
```

#### 2. Build System Integration

Create a `meson.build` file for your plugin. If your plugin requires external dependencies:

```meson
# Check for required dependency
your_dep = dependency('your-dependency', required: false)
if not your_dep.found()
    subdir_done()  # Skip building this plugin
endif

# Build the plugin
your_plugin_lib = shared_library(
    'YOUR_PLUGIN',
    your_sources,
    dependencies: plugin_deps + [your_dep],
    cpp_args: compile_defs + ['-fPIC'],
    include_directories: [nixl_inc_dirs, utils_inc_dirs],
    install: true,
    name_prefix: 'libplugin_',
    install_dir: plugin_install_dir)
```

#### 3. Container Build Extension

If your plugin requires system dependencies, update `contrib/Dockerfile`. See existing examples for compiling dependencies from source:

```dockerfile
# Example: Building a dependency from source
WORKDIR /workspace
RUN git clone https://github.com/example/your-dependency.git && \
    cd your-dependency && \
    mkdir build && cd build && \
    cmake .. && \
    make -j$(nproc) && \
    make install

# Or for autotools-based projects:
RUN cd /usr/local/src && \
    git clone https://github.com/example/your-lib.git && \
    cd your-lib && \
    ./autogen.sh && \
    ./configure --enable-feature && \
    make -j && \
    make install && \
    ldconfig
```

#### 4. Plugin Documentation

Your plugin's README.md must include:

- **Overview**: Basic functionality description
- **Dependencies**: List all external requirements
- **Build Instructions**: How to build with/without the plugin
- **API Reference**: Key classes and functions
- **Example Usage**: Simple, working example

### Plugin Testing

1. **Unit tests**: Test individual components in `test/gtest/unit/plugins/your_plugin/`
2. **Integration tests**: Test plugin with NIXL framework
3. **Example validation**: Ensure examples compile and run

## Testing Requirements

### Test Framework

- New tests should use GoogleTest framework in `test/gtest/`
- Legacy tests may exist in other locations
- Run tests with: `ninja -C build test`

### Test Coverage

- New features must include comprehensive tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Test both success and error paths

### Test Organization

```cpp
// Example unit test
TEST(YourPlugin, HandlesValidInput) {
    // Test implementation
}

TEST(YourPlugin, HandlesInvalidInput) {
    // Test error handling
}
```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

Document public APIs and complex implementations:

```cpp
/**
 * Brief description of the function
 *
 * Detailed explanation if needed
 *
 * @param param1 Description of parameter
 * @return Description of return value
 */
```

### PR Documentation

Use the provided template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

1. **What?**: Clear description of changes
2. **Why?**: Justification and issue references
3. **How?**: Technical approach for complex changes

## Miscelaneous

- NIXL's default build assumes recent versions of
  dependencies (CUDA, PyTorch, etc.).
  Contributions that add compatibility with older versions of
  those dependencies will be considered, but NVIDIA cannot guarantee
  that all possible build configurations work, are not broken by
  future contributions, and retain highest performance.

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no
  license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code).
  You must certify compliance with the
  [license terms](https://github.com/dynemo-ai/nixl/blob/main/LICENSE)
  and sign off on the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org)
  described below before your pull request (PR) can be merged.

- Thanks in advance for your patience as we review your contributions;
  we do appreciate them!
